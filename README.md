## Installation in your Project

Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file. Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```java
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```

Step 2. Add the dependency

```java
dependencies {
        implementation 'com.github.aabhasr1:OtpView:v1.1.2-ktx' // kotlin
}
```

  or

```java
dependencies {
        implementation 'com.github.aabhasr1:OtpView:v1.1.2'
}
```

## How to use the library?

Just add the following to your **xml** design to show the otpview

```xml
.....
<in.aabhasjindal.otptextview.OtpTextView
	android:id="@+id/otp_view"
	android:layout_width="wrap_content"
	android:layout_height="wrap_content"
	android:textColor="#ffffff"
	app:height="40dp"
	app:width="40dp"
	app:bar_enabled="true"
	app:bar_height="2dp"
	app:length="4"
	app:otp="1234"
	app:otp_text_size="24dp"/>
.....
```

To get a callback when the user enters the otp make use of `OTPListener` Interface

```java
private OtpTextView otpTextView;
otpTextView = findViewById(R.id.otp_view);
otpTextView.setOtpListener(new OTPListener() {
	@Override
	public void onInteractionListener() {
	// fired when user types something in the Otpbox
	}
	@Override
	public void onOTPComplete(String otp) {
	// fired when user has entered the OTP fully.
	    Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "The OTP is " + otp,  Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
});
```

you also get some additional methods like :

```java
otpTextView.getOtpListener();  // retrieves the current OTPListener (null if nothing is set)
otpTextView.requestFocusOTP();	//sets the focus to OTP box (does not open the keyboard)
otpTextView.setOTP(otpString);	// sets the entered otpString in the Otp box (for case when otp is retreived from SMS)
otpTextView.getOTP();	// retrieves the OTP entered by user (works for partial otp input too)
otpTextView.showSuccess();	// shows the success state to the user (can be set a bar color or drawable)
otpTextView.showError();	// shows the success state to the user (can be set a bar color or drawable)
otpTextView.resetState();	// brings the views back to default state (the state it was at input)
```

Thats all for now but new additions will be made frequently.
